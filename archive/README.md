# Archive

This folder contains preserved, no-longer-active code.

- `archive/omniweb3-mcp/` — archived in favor of the actively developed multi-chain MCP server at `web3mcp/`.

Rationale:
- Reduce confusion between multiple MCP servers.
- Keep one actively maintained multi-chain server.
- Preserve older implementations for reference.
